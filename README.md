This openFrameworks application allows to send images to APA102 LED strips (and, optionally, DMX) through a bunch of teensy-based bridge applications (code included as a submodule) via SLIP-OSC.

Some ofAddons are necessary to build this app:
- https://github.com/avilleret/ofxSerial.git - on the feature/SLIPSerialExample branch
- https://github.com/bakercp/ofxIO.git (on branch stable)
